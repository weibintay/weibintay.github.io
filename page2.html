 Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three
meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat
Bunce, and skinny
 Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox
and his family surrounded. What they don't know is that
they're not dealing
 with just any foxâ€“Mr. Fox would never surrender.
But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.
